 * Like Redux actions, actions in grox are:
 *
 *
 *  * responsible for changing the state
 *  * they only produce a new state out of an old state. State being immutable.
 *  * they are pure functions, have no side effects, have no dependencies that are not pure. They
 * are fully reproducible.
 *  * they are fully testable.
 *
 *
 * Typically, an action is a state less object, has no dependencies and is tested.
 *
 * @param <STATE> the class of the state.
